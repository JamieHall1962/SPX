# Risk Management Plan

## Pre-Trade Checks
- Position size limits (max contracts per trade)
- Total exposure limits (max total position)
- Price sanity checks (reject if price looks wrong)
- Time window checks (no trading near market close)
- Margin requirements check

## Active Position Monitoring
- P&L thresholds (stop if losing too much)
- Position limits (prevent over-trading)
- Drawdown limits
- Rate limiting on orders

## System Safety
- Emergency stop button
- Auto-shutdown on connection loss
- Daily loss limits
- Max orders per minute
- Duplicate order prevention

## Implementation Notes
- Each feature needs careful testing
- Consider implications for existing code
- Add gradually to ensure stability
- Test each addition thoroughly
- Document all thresholds and limits

## Future Considerations
- Logging of all risk checks
- Alert system for limit breaches
- Regular risk report generation
- Back-testing of risk parameters
